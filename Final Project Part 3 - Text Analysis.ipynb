In contrast to the other big tech companies that were compared to Alphabet (Facebook, Apple, etc.), Google was likely the only firm with a life sciences acquisition in that dataset."

    "This project examined which companies would be most likely to be acquired by Google's parent company Alphabet from a list of firms that went public between January 1st, 2015, and December 31st, 2019. The initial hypothesis suggested that the result would likely point in the direction of Google's 'other bets' groups, where a company focused on some form of deep research or innovation would most likely be acquired to complement Google's existing and growing enterprises on these fronts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple regression was first run, but the low R^2 of only ~20% suggested that this model should not be used. A logistic regression was also tested, but the model proved unreliable and was also abandoned. However, the decision tree model was able to separate the data into 12 (11) distinct groups, from which point it was combined with the text-based analysis to determine that 10X Genomics Inc., A California-based biotechnology company, would be the most likely to be acquired by Alphabet. This result is in line with the initial hypothesis, as Google has a life sciences research division as part of their 'other bets' group. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model itself does presents some risks, particularly with respect to the quantity and quality of the data that was used, and these aspects are what would need to be improved on as a next step from what this project's model predicted."
